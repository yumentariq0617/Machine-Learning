  This project focuses on classifying different species of penguins using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet effective machine learning model. The dataset, which includes various features like island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex, is preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the KNN model. The project showcases how the KNN algorithm can be applied to real-world data to achieve accurate species classification, demonstrating the practical applications of machine learning in biological studies.
